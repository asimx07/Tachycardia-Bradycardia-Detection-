# Tachycardia-Bradycardia-Detection-

In Tachycardia-Bradycardia syndrome, your heart fluctuates between beating too quickly (tachycardia) and too slowly (bradycardia).

This project performs Biosignal processing on ECG signals collected from smart-ecg wearable devices to detect the Tachycardia or Bradycardia.
